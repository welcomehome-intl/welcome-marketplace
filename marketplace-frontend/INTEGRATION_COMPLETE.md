## Next Steps: Deployment

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts
```bash
cd /home/mrima/welcomehome-smart-contract

# Add your private key to .env
cp .env .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your private key

# Deploy both contracts
forge script script/DeployTokenHandler.s.sol:DeployTokenHandler \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.hashio.io/api \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    --legacy
```

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration
Copy the deployed contract addresses to `/home/mrima/welcomehome/.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPERTY_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x_your_deployed_token_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPERTY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x_your_deployed_handler_address
```

### 3. Start the Application
