# Deployment Summary - Fixed Property Creation Issue

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Network:** Hedera Testnet (Chain ID: 296)
**Deployer:** 0xD1B156294aFa63d7d174D06D5A83e547d7a5abA9

---

## Problem Identified

Properties created via the admin panel were not appearing in listings. Investigation revealed:

1. **Frontend validation issue:** Form was requiring `symbol` and `location` parameters that the smart contract doesn't accept
2. **Contract deployment mismatch:** Previously deployed contracts didn't match the source code
3. **Permission issue:** PropertyFactory contract was calling `ownershipRegistry.setAuthorizedUpdater()` at line 122, which requires `onlyAdmin` modifier, but PropertyFactory only had `propertyManager` role

### Root Cause
The critical issue was at **PropertyFactory.sol:122**:
```solidity
ownershipRegistry.setAuthorizedUpdater(tokenAddress, true);
```

This function in OwnershipRegistry requires `onlyAdmin`, but PropertyFactory was only a property manager, not an admin.

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Frontend Validation
**File:** `app/lib/web3/hooks/use-property-factory.ts`
**Change:** Removed validation for `symbol` and `location` parameters since they're not required by the contract

### 2. Redeployed All Contracts
Redeployed with correct source code to Hedera Testnet:

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| **AccessControl** | `0xDDAE60c136ea61552c1e6acF3c7Ab8beBd02eF69` |
| **OwnershipRegistry** | `0x4Eb9F441eA43141572BC49a4e8Fdf53f44B5C99C` |
| **PropertyFactory** | `0x366e65Ca8645086478454c89C3616Ba0bAf15A35` |
| **Marketplace** | `0x74347e6046819f6cbc64eb301746c7AaDA614Dec` |

### 3. Configured Permissions
Applied proper configuration:
```bash
# Made PropertyFactory an admin (required for setAuthorizedUpdater)
cast send AccessControl "setAdmin(address,bool)" PropertyFactory true

# Authorized PropertyFactory in OwnershipRegistry
cast send OwnershipRegistry "setAuthorizedUpdater(address,bool)" PropertyFactory true

# Set deployer as property manager
cast send AccessControl "setPropertyManager(address,bool)" deployer true
```

### 4. Updated Frontend Addresses
- Updated `app/lib/web3/addresses.ts` with new contract addresses
- Updated `.env.local` with new deployment addresses

---

## Verification

Successfully created test property on-chain:

```bash
cast send PropertyFactory "createProperty(string,string,uint256,uint256,uint256)" \
  "My First Property" \
  "ipfs://QmRealTest456" \
  500000000000000000000 \
  2000 \
  250000000000000000
```

**Result:**
- Transaction: `0xe09759042a60db63b1b8d09910a9e7aa7bd973f215fd6759424446e9ffca7b57`
- Status: Success
- Property Count: `1`
- Token Contract: `0xb707dcd97731781c7dcdfc7606163b0991507ecd`

## Key Architectural Insight

**PropertyFactory must be an admin** because it needs to authorize newly created PropertyToken contracts in the OwnershipRegistry. This is a design requirement, not a bug.

The authorization chain:
1. Admin creates property via PropertyFactory
2. PropertyFactory deploys new PropertyToken
3. PropertyFactory calls `ownershipRegistry.setAuthorizedUpdater(newToken, true)` ‚Üê **Requires admin role**
4. PropertyToken can now update ownership records

---

## Next Steps

### For Testing the Complete Flow:

1. **Restart dev server** to load new addresses:
   ```bash
   cd /home/mrima/welcome/welcomehome
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Admin creates property:**
   - Go to admin panel (/admin)
   - Fill out property form (symbol and location are optional)
   - Submit transaction
   - Wait for Hedera confirmation

3. **Verify property appears in listings:**
   - Go to marketplace (/marketplace)
   - Should see newly created property

4. **User purchases tokens:**
   - Click on property
   - View property details
   - Purchase tokens (requires KYC)

### Current System Status:
- All contracts deployed
- PropertyFactory has admin role
- Deployer (0xD1B...abA9) has admin and propertyManager roles
- One test property created (ID: 0)

## Files Modified

- `buner-welcome/src/PropertyFactory.sol` - Restored modifiers after testing
- `welcomehome/app/lib/web3/hooks/use-property-factory.ts` - Removed invalid validation
- `welcomehome/app/lib/web3/addresses.ts` - Updated contract addresses
- `welcomehome/.env.local` - Updated environment variables

---

## Important Notes

1. **PropertyFactory MUST be admin:** This is required for the authorization mechanism to work
2. **Symbol is auto-generated:** Contract generates symbol as `PROP{id}` (e.g., PROP0, PROP1)
3. **Location stored in IPFS:** Location data should be in the metadata JSON at the IPFS URI
4. **KYC required for purchases:** All token buyers must be KYC-verified

---

## Troubleshooting

If properties still don't appear:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify contract addresses in `.env.local` match deployed addresses
3. Clear browser cache and restart dev server
4. Check transaction on HashScan: https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/{txHash}
5. Query PropertyFactory directly:
   ```bash
   cast call 0x366e65Ca8645086478454c89C3616Ba0bAf15A35 "getPropertyCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url https://testnet.hashio.io/api
   ```
